### 💾 Data Portability & Compatibility
While **Data Portability** is a core pillar of this project, please be aware that our internal data schemas are evolving rapidly during this Pre-Alpha phase.

* **Compatibility:** Export files created in an older version may not be compatible with newer versions until we reach a stable data format (v1.0).
* **Recommendation:** Keep a backup of your data, but expect to perform a "fresh start" if the data structure undergoes a major shift between updates.
